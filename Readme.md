As per recommendation by reviewer "GodknowsSibelo" I got into JavaFX and SceneBuilder
and rebuilt this app (previously swing elements)

It was very hard but eventually I read enought tutorials and watched enough youtube videos 
to put it together in a way that felt right.

But is it best practice? I don't know. I am with Hyperion Dev to learn the "right" way to program,
when I'm learning from other sources I'm not sure if I've got it right :(
